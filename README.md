# MultiplayerSnakeGame

## Setup

1. Clone repo
2. Install packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure settings in config.ini. For now, please set multiplayer to "no"
4. Run `python client.py` to play!

To have 4 bots play against eachother until they break something, run `python uitester.py`. This also shows the color palette that can be changes in `graphics.py`.

The `examples` directory shows a few simple TCP and UDP communications
